## Assignment 3 - Frequency Analysis
### Shaun Partridge
### Description:

I received two files that were encrypted using a "substitution" cipher. The genius whom encrypted these, randomly shuffled a list of letters multiple times. The problem is, he never sent me the key! So, I cannot reverse the process. I need your help to decipher these messages.It is not a shift cipher, so you cant brute force the shift value! So the only way to get these two messages vital to the safety of earth is to run a frequency analysis on them.

### Files

|   #   |  File                            |  Description                           |

|   1   |   [ciphertext_1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaunJPartridge/4663-Cryptography-Partridge/master/Assignments/A03/ciphertext_1.txt)   | First encrypted file to decrypt |
|   2   |   [ciphertext_2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaunJPartridge/4663-Cryptography-Partridge/master/Assignments/A03/ciphertext_2.txt)   | Second encrypted file to decrypt  |
